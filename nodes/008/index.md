## Requirement

> [**Upload Assignment: Midterm Prototype Demonstration**](https://blackboard.syracuse.edu/webapps/assignment/uploadAssignment?content_id=_9312317_1&course_id=_499687_1&group_id=&mode=view)
>
> Date: `October 17 & 19`
>
> 1. `Time`: Each team is required to present/demo their prototype for about `15 min`. (-1 if < 13 min.; -2 if < 9 min.)
>
> 2. Each team member is expected to **present/demo** the part(s) he/she is responsible for. 
>
> 3. The live demo is the most critical part of this presentation. (no demo: -3; light-weight demo: -1.5) Powerpoint slides are not strictly required this time. However, if you decide not to create slides, you should take plenty of screenshots of your system and submit them as part of the term project deliverables (due October 20). You could also submit a video of your live demo, in lieu of the Powerpoint slides.
>
> 4. You should also mention any design patterns and design principles you have applied to your term project. (1 point each)
>
> 5. You should also mention which requirements (from your original SRS) have been or will be implemented, which will not. (1 point)
>
> 6. You should submit your `slides` (at least 10 slides, not including the title page and non-substantive slides) or video by `October 20 (Friday)`. Each team only needs to submit one copy. Usually it's the team lead's job to submit it. Late submission penalty: 1/day.
>
> 7. Equal contribution is assumed. If not, please add a slide to describe each member's contribution, preferably with percenatges, as you did for your weekly reports.
